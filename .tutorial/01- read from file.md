# Reading From a File

Once we've got data into a file, wouldn't it be just splendid to load it back into our program to use again?


Yes. Yes is the answer you're looking for.  



## Open

ðŸ‘‰ The code to load from a file is pretty similar to that for writing.  The command is `open` instead of `read`, and the permissions are slightly different.



```python
f = open("filenames.list", "r")
```

## Read and Close

ðŸ‘‰ In this example, the permission 'r' means 'read only'. Now we load the contents of the file into a variable using the `read` function. Next, close the file to free up the RAM used to store it.
```python
f = open("filenames.list", "r")
contents = f.read()
f.close()
```

## Print

ðŸ‘‰ Finally output the contents of the 'contents' variable to test that it worked.

```python
f = open("filenames.list", "r")
contents = f.read()
f.close()

print(contents)
```
## Split

 Bringing everything in in one go is fine, but it would be much more useful to have it as separate items so we can examine it more easily.

ðŸ‘‰ To do this, use the `.split()` function in the second to last line. This splits the string into a list of individual elements.

```python
f = open("filenames.list", "r")
contents = f.read()
f.close()

contents = contents.split() #added split here

print(contents)
```
